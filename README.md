# Craft Unique Value

A fieldtype for Craft that will force the contents to be unique across all instances of that field.


### Todo someday

- Add field setting to switch whether field is unique to all instances or Section
- Re-write js to match the Craft way
- Make it work with the Entries API - at present it will validate even if it shouldnâ€™t when saved in this way
